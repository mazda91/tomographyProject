Question 1)
 in Framework class : being able to choose the image from the imageList ! not from a function, otherwise the list has no interest                                                    
 in Framework class : display the current image






problem with the sinogram : the sinogram of a single circle must be independent on the angle of projection phi.
                            But it's not the case, because, as the length sMax of the line with direction thetaPhi depends on phi
                            sMax varies. Then, discretizing [-sMax,sMax] and [-sMax -1, -sMax + 1] (exemple) doesn't lead to the same
                            projection line distances to the origin, then not the same projections.
