Question 1)
 in Framework class : being able to choose the image from the imageList ! not from a function, otherwise the list has no interest                                                    
 in Framework class : display the current image

optimize lengthLineIntersection ?

at the end of sinogram function : retrieve radonTransform(done) + phi interval + s interval 
why ? : providing them for the integrale function in moment function

overload dotProduct operator

in setCurrentImage : case if input order is greater than the length of the list
